## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For iOS

```bash
# get your id iphone
xcrun simctl list devices
# using npm
npx react-native run-ios -- --udid='HERE-YOUR-ID'
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _iOS device_ .

## Congratulations!
